# DEDE: Deep Garment Design and Analysis

A deep learning framework for 3D garment analysis, generation, and manipulation using point cloud-based Variational Autoencoders (VAE).

## Overview

DEDE (Deep Cloth Simulation for Garment Design) is a deep learning project that focuses on:
- 3D garment segmentation and reconstruction from real scans
- Garment generation and interpolation
- Point cloud-based garment representation and manipulation

Built using PyTorch, Kaolin, and Streamlit, this project provides both a training pipeline and an interactive web interface for garment manipulation.

## Features

- ðŸ§  Point Cloud VAE for garment encoding and generation
- ðŸ”„ Garment interpolation between different styles
- ðŸ‘• Support for various garment types
- ðŸŽ¨ Interactive 3D visualization
- ðŸ“Š Web-based interface for garment manipulation

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DEDE.git
cd DEDE

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

1. Train the model:
```bash
python src/train.py --data_path path/to/dataset
```

2. Run the web interface:
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## Dataset

This project uses the Multi-Garment Network dataset:
- 712 digital garments in correspondence
- Different clothing types and styles
- Real 3D scans of people in different clothing and poses
